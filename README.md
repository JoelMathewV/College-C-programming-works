# College-C-programming-works
This is the repo for sharing all the C programming related works being done in College of Engineering Karunagappally.

# Important points to note
1. Try doing the programs yourself first and then refer the codes
2. If you have any suggestions regarding the codes that is written here you can comment it or create a Pull Request(PR)
3. These programs are written in VS Code from my end using gcc compiler. So the program may work differently in other online compilers
4. These programs are raw i.e just the main parts are written such as printf and scanf. So the program is correct and if u want u can tweak according to ur need. 
5. further notices, updates, features will be done later.

## Happy coding
